Material design is a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design
that adapts across different devices. Material design is inspired by tactile
materials, such as paper and ink. Material surfaces interact in a shared
space. Surfaces can have elevation (z-height) and cast shadows on other
surfaces to convey relationships.

{{site.project_title}}'s [paper elements collection](/docs/elements/paper-elements.html)
implements material design for the web. The [{{site.project_title}} core elements
collection](/docs/elements/core-elements.html) provides a number of unthemed
elements that you can use to achieve material design app layouts, transitions,
and scrolling effects.

For more detail on the material design philosophy and guidelines, see the
[Material design specification](http://google.com/design/spec).

For a sample of the material design patterns in use, see the <a href="/apps/topeka/" target="_blank">Topeka sample app</a>.

For quick visual demos of many of the paper elements, see the <a href="/components/paper-elements/demo.html" target="_blank">Paper elements sampler</a>.

## Application layout

The {{site.project_title}} core elements set includes several elements for application layout,
including creating toolbars, app bars, tabs, and side nav consistent with the
material design guidelines.

See [Layout elements](layout-elements.html) for information on
using these elements.

To work well with the {{site.project_title}} layout elements, you should make sure other
parts of your app follow the same metrics described in the [material design
spec](http://google.com/design/spec), such as:

* Baseline grids
* Keylines
* Touch target size

## Icons

Material design uses icons extensively. {{site.project_title}} provides access
to a large variety of scalable, tintable  SVG icons using the `<core-icon>`
element and its associated icon sets. Using `<core-icon>` can be as simple as:

    <link rel="import" href="/components/core-icons/core-icons.html">
    <core-icon icon="info"></core-icon>

`core-icons.html` is a utility import that includes the `<core-icon>` element
and the default icon set, which  includes over 150 common icons. Here are a
few examples:

<div class="icondemo" layout horizontal wrap>
  <core-icon icon="send"></core-icon>
  <core-icon icon="credit-card"></core-icon>
  <core-icon icon="visibility" style="fill: #5168ff;"></core-icon>
  <core-icon icon="favorite" style="fill: #d61a7f;"></core-icon>
  <core-icon icon="polymer" style="fill: #9f499b;"></core-icon>
  <core-icon icon="save"></core-icon>
  <core-icon icon="language"></core-icon>
</div>
<div class="icondemo" layout horizontal>
</div>

For details on using `<core-icon>` and its relatives, see
[Using core icons](icons.html).

## Material controls

The paper elements collection includes a number of material-themed controls
for all common areas of your application. The following table shows the common
controls.

<table class="demo-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Control</th>

## Dialogs, snackbars, and toasts

Dialogs, snackbars and toasts all appear as a separate sheet, overlaying the
background. The paper element collection includes two elements.

-   A _dialog_ (`<paper-dialog>`) is a modal window that can include a title,
    text, action buttons, and other controls.

-   A _snackbar_ or _toast_ (`<paper-toast>`) is a small, transient popup that
    includes a message and optionally a _single_ action (such as "undo").

### Dialogs

Use the `<paper-dialog>` element to create a dialog. Set a title on a dialog
using the `heading` published property.

You can use any kind of children inside the dialog. For action buttons, add
the `dismissive` or `affirmative` attributes to place the controls (typically
buttons) at the bottom of the dialog:

-   `dismissive` actions, like **Cancel**, close the dialog and return to the
    previous screen without making changes. They're displayed on the left.

-   `affirmative` actions, like **OK** or **Save** continue a process or
    confirm a decision. They're displayed on the right.

The following example creates a dialog with two buttons:

    <paper-dialog id="dialog" heading="Launch?"
                  transition="paper-dialog-transition-bottom">
      <p>This app would like to launch a small, unmanned vehicle
         into space.</p>
      <paper-button dismissive>Cancel</paper-button>
      <paper-button affirmative default>OK</paper-button>
    </paper-dialog>

<paper-dialog id="dialog" heading="Launch?" transition="paper-dialog-transition-bottom">
<p>This app would like to launch a small, unmanned vehicle into space.</p>

<paper-button dismissive>Cancel</paper-button>
<paper-button affirmative default>OK</paper-button>

</paper-dialog>

<paper-button id="dialog-button" raised>Show me the dialog</paper-button>

In this example, the default button has a `default` attribute. The dialog
doesn't apply any special treatment for a default option; you can style it
differently using CSS.

Dialogs are hidden by default. Call the dialog's `toggle` method to show or
hide it.

<a href="/components/paper-elements/demo.html#paper-dialog">
<core-icon icon="arrow-forward" size="16"></core-icon> More examples</a>

### Snackbars & toasts

A `<paper-toast>` element appears at the bottom of the screen or on the
lower-left on mobile. Use the `text` attribute to specify the text to display.

    <paper-toast id="toast" text="Your draft has been discarded."></paper-toast>

<paper-toast id="toast" text="Your draft has been discarded."></paper-toast>

<paper-button id="toast-button" raised>Show me the snackbar</paper-button>

Like a dialog, a `<paper-toast>` is hidden by default. Call the element's
`open` method to display it. The toast disappears after a timeout, or can be
dismissed by swiping.

<a href="/components/paper-elements/demo.html#paper-toast">
<core-icon icon="arrow-forward" size="16"></core-icon> More examples</a>

## Material effects

When designing your own components or using generic HTML elements such as
`<div>`s, you can add material design effects using the `<paper-ripple>` and
`<paper-shadow>` elements.

### Touch ripple effect

Material responds to input events with a touch ripple effect: an animation
that moves out radially from the origin of the event. These effects are built
into the
[paper elements collection](paper-elements.html):

<paper-button class="purpleRipple" raised>Show me the ripple</paper-button>

When working with other elements, you can use the `<paper-ripple>` element to
create a touch ripple effect.

To use `<paper-ripple>`, declare a `<paper-ripple>` element as a child of the
element you want to add the effect to:

    <div>
      <paper-ripple fit></paper-ripple>
    </div>

Touch the cards and icon below to see ripple effects.

<div layout horizontal wrap>
  <div class="labeled-card" layout vertical>
    <div class="demo-card">
      <paper-ripple fit></paper-ripple>
    </div>
    <p>Default ripple</p>
  </div>

  <div class="labeled-card" layout vertical>
    <div class="demo-card">
      <paper-ripple fit style="color: red;"></paper-ripple>
    </div>
    <p>Colored ripple</p>
  </div>

  <div class="labeled-card" layout vertical>
    <div class="demo-card" style="border: none;" layout vertical center-center>
      <core-icon icon="info"></core-icon>
      <paper-ripple fit class="circle"></paper-ripple>
    </div>
    <p>Circular ripple</p>
  </div>
</div>

The `<paper-ripple>` should be `position: absolute` and sized to fit the
parent element. In  this example, the `fit` layout attribute is used to
position the ripple appropriately.  (See
[layout attributes](/docs/polymer/layout-attrs.html) for information on `fit`
and other layout attributes.)

You can clip the ripple to a circle by adding the `circle` class to the
ripple's `classlist`. Circular ripples are used for small buttons used in a grid
layout (for example, icon buttons, number pads).

You can set the color of the ripple using the `color` CSS property.

    paper-ripple {
      color: red;
    }

When using a paper element, check the element API doc to find the CSS selector
to style the ripple. Elements that have a ripple have a `<paper-ripple>`
in the shadow DOM. For example, to style a  button:

    paper-button::shadow paper-ripple {
      color: blue;
    }

To style a checkbox:

    paper-checkbox::shadow paper-ripple {
      color: blue;
    }

### Shadow effect

Material has an apparent elevation (z-height) and casts shadows. In {{site.project_title}},
elements can  have a z-height between 0 and 5. Material can raise or lower in
response to user input.

**Note:** The material design specification describes z-heights as being
specified in display independent pixels (DIPs). The current implementation of
`<paper-shadow>` doesn't correspond to the spec in this regard. The z-values
are arbitrary values ranging from 0 (no elevation) to 5 (maximum elevation), and don't
correspond to DIPs.
{: .alert .alert-info }

The `paper-elements` have shadow effects built-in. For example, a
`<paper-button>` declared  with the `raised` attribute appears raised
above the surface it rests on, and raises  up when touched.

    <paper-button raised>Raised button</paper-button>

<paper-button raised>Raised button</paper-button>

When building your own elements or using standard DOM elements, you can use
the `<paper-shadow>`  element to create the appropriate shadow effect.

To apply a shadow to an element, simply use a `<paper-shadow>` element as a
container. The `<paper-shadow>` element automatically adds a shadow around its contents.
The `<paper-shadow>` element is `display: block` by default.

    <style>
      .span-shadow {
        display: inline-block;
        padding: 8px;
      }
    </style>
    <paper-shadow z="3" class="span-shadow">
      <span>I have a shadow!</span>
    </paper-shadow>

<style>
  .span-shadow {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 8px;
  }
</style>
<paper-shadow z="3" class="span-shadow">
  <span>I have a shadow!</span>
</paper-shadow>

You can set the **initial** z-height of the target element by setting the `z` attribute on the
`<paper-shadow>`  element. Z values range from 0 (no shadow) to 5.

<div layout horizontal>
  <paper-shadow z="1" class="demo-card">
    <p>z = 1</p>
  </paper-shadow>
  <paper-shadow z="3" class="demo-card">
    <p>z = 3</p>
  </paper-shadow>
  <paper-shadow z="5" class="demo-card">
    <p>z = 5</p>
  </paper-shadow>
</div>

Changing the `z` attribute after the element is instantiated has no effect.
To change the z height dynamically, call the `setZ` method.

    this.$.my-shadow.setZ(5);

The apparent height of the element (the z-height value) is absolute &mdash;
that is, an  element with a z-height of 3 casts the same size shadow
regardless of the z-heights of  the background elements. In addition, the
z-height does not affect the stacking order of  elements. To change stacking
order of sibling elements, use the `z-index` CSS property as  usual.

**Note:**
The `<paper-shadow>` element's behavior changed in version 0.5.0.
Prior to 0.5.0, the `<paper-shadow>` element added a shadow to its
_parent element_, and supported changing the z-height by setting the
`z` property directly.
{: .alert .alert-info }

<a href="/components/paper-elements/demo.html#paper-shadow">
<core-icon icon="arrow-forward" size="16"></core-icon> More examples</a>


## Transitions

Support for transitions is rapidly evolving. The `<core-animated-pages>`
element displays a single child element at a time, and provides support for
sophisticated transitions between two children, or _pages_.

You can define a set of transitions to be executed when transitioning between
pages. To provide visual continuity across transitions, animated pages support
_hero transitions_, where a selected element on the starting page appears to
morph into a related element on the ending page. Use hero transitions to link
important elements together, while using a simpler transition such as a
cross-fade for the remaining elements.

For example transitions, see the [`<core-animated-pages>` demos](/components/core-animated-pages/demo.html).
The <a href="/apps/topeka/" target="_blank">Topeka sample app</a> also
demonstrates a number of transitions in context.

## Scrolling techniques

The [`<core-scroll-header-panel>`](/docs/elements/core-elements.html#core-scroll-header-panel)
element supports a number of scrolling effects described in the material
design spec, including condensing and expanding the toolbar as the user
scrolls and hiding or showing the toolbar.

For resizing toolbars, `<core-scroll-header-panel>` lets you define how to
transition the toolbar's contents between states &mdash; resizing text,
showing or hiding /components, and cross-fading between backgrounds, for
example.

See the [`<core-scroll-header-panel>` demos](/components/core-scroll-header-panel/demo.html)
for some examples of the effects possible.

    .addEventListener('click', function() {
      document.getElementById('toast').show();

      console.log('Showing dialog...');
      document.getElementById('dialog').toggle();
