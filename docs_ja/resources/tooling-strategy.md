## Build status

If something seems terribly wrong, check out {{site.project_title}}'s [build status page](/build/).

## Vulcanize - element build tool

> Vulcanization is process that turns polymers into more durable materials.

[Vulcanize](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize) is a tool to concatenate a set of web components into a single file. It's our current recommendation for a "build step". Read more about it in "[Concatenating Web Components with Vulcanize](/articles/concatenating-web-components.html)".

## Debugging Shadow DOM

In Chrome, author defined Shadow DOM is inspectable using the DevTools.

To inspect Shadow DOM defined by the user agent (e.g. the Shadow DOM of `<input type="date">`),
turn on "Show user agent shadow DOM" in the DevTools general settings:

![Enable "Show user agent shadow DOM" in the Devtools](/images/showshadowdom.png 'Enable "Show user agent shadow DOM" in the Devtools')

After reloading the DevTools, user agent Shadow DOM should be inspectable. It will render as `#shadow-root (user-agent)`s in element inspector.

## Source maps

{{site.project_title}}  polyfills the [HTML Imports](/platform/html-imports.html) specification. In order for code to be debuggable at run-time, scripts embedded in components are injected into `<head>` in the main document. Tools/browsers that support [source maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) will identify these scripts as belonging to their source components.

## Building &amp; testing

To run build individual polyfills or run tests, you need `node` and `grunt-cli` on your system.

* install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) using the instructions on their website
* use `npm` to install the [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com) task runner for the command-line

      npm install -g grunt-cli

### Building individual polyfills

If you're interested in using an individual polyfill by itself (e.g. rather that the prebuilt webcomponents.js bundle),
you need to build the minified file.

**Example** - building the CustomElements polyfill

    $ mkdir cepolyfill; cd cepolyfill

    $ git clone https://github.com/Polymer/MutationObservers

    $ git clone https://github.com/Polymer/tools

    $ git clone https://github.com/Polymer/CustomElements

    $ cd CustomElements

    $ npm install

    $ grunt

**Note**: As seen in the example above, you may need to install other repo dependencies for the build to succeed. For example, the CustomElement polyfills requires `MutationObservers` and the `tools` repos. Sometime it is useful to look in the repo's [build.json](https://github.com/Polymer/CustomElements/blob/master/build.json) file for requirements.

### Running the tests

For any repository that contains tests, in the project's root folder (e.g. `<somepath>/platform-dev/`), run:

    npm install

#### Tasks

Once things are installed, you may run the tests or use `grunt` to perform tasks.

Build minified project files (default):

    grunt

Run tests:

    grunt test

## Development workflow & tooling

We are currently in the early stages of investigating modern front-end tooling for projects built with {{site.project_title}}. This includes using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) for scaffolding out {{site.project_title}} elements, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for building and optimizing projects and [Bower](http://bower.io) for component dependency management.

While our work in this area is just beginning, take a look at the potential workflow:

<div class="centered" style="margin:20px;"><iframe id="video" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EwQkyplZHDY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The [{{site.project_title}} + Grunt](https://github.com/addyosmani/polymer-grunt-example) proof-of-concept project is a good start. Also follow our work on [generator-polymer](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer/).

## Using git {#git}

**Note:** This section is for advanced users who want to hack on Polymer or submit a pull request. If you just want to use Polymer in a project we recommend using Bower. Please follow our guide at [Getting the Code](/docs/start/getting-the-code.html).
{: .alert .alert-error}

### Clone the project {#clone}

You can clone {{site.project_title}}'s important repositories
by running our `pull-all.sh` script:

    mkdir polymer_local; cd polymer_local
    git clone https://github.com/Polymer/tools.git
    ./tools/bin/pull-all.sh

<!-- <p class="centered"><a href="/tools/pull-all.sh" target="_blank" class="btn btn-success" alt="Download pull-all.sh" title="Download pull-all.sh"><i class="icon-white icon-download"></i> Download pull-all.sh</a></p>
 -->

Go grab a coffee. This takes a few minutes!

`pull-all.sh` is great for hacking on the code or if you want the individual polyfill repositories. It creates two directories, `components/` and `projects/`, and checks out a number of sibling repositories to each folder.

**components/**

- *components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.js* — The platform shims and polyfills.
- *components/polymer/polymer.js* — [{{site.project_title}} core](/docs/polymer/polymer.html)
- *components/core-elements/* — A folder of the meta collection of the core elements.
- A directory for each polyfill repo (CustomElements, HTMLImports, ShadowDOM).

**projects/**

Full and sample applications.

### Test your environment {#testgit}

To check that your development environment is ready, try running the designer tool:

    cd projects/designer
    bower install

Start a web server and navigate to the designer app.

### Updating checkouts {#updategit}

To update your local copies, re-run `pull-all.sh`:

    ./tools/bin/pull-all.sh

### About the repositories {#abouttherepos}

The entirety of the {{site.project_title}} is composed of a many Git
repositories. All of the polyfill libraries, projects, and individual elements
each have their own repository.

Specification repositories (da polyfills)

Each new web platform specification has a corresponding polyfill repository. The
reasoning for this is two-fold:

1. make the polyfills work across all modern browsers
2. each polyfill can stand on its own and be used à la carte in projects.

For example, the following repositories may be useful if you're interested in the individual API:

* `CustomElements`
* `HTMLImports`
* `PointerEvents`
* `PointerGestures`
* `ShadowDOM`
* `web-animations-js`
